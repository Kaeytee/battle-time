# Battle Time ðŸ¥³


## Assignment
Your assignment is to build an onboarding interface for a space battle game. You will be provided
access to a set of Invision design files with the layout of the interface. All assets are already
in place in the battle-app package.

## Requirements
- Styling - All styling must be done using [at-dot-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iyio/at-dot-css). See Index.tsx for an example.
- Layout - All layout should be done using either flex box or grid layouts.
- TypeScript - All code must be written in TypeScript.
- Components - All React components must be functional components.
- Data Driven - Use the Questions API to retrieve the content for the questions displayed. A variable amount of questions should be accounted for. See Index.tsx for an example.
- Response Submissions - The answers selected by the user should be collected and POSTed to the Questions endpoint when the user presses the "Let's rock n' roll" button at the end of onboarding. The URL to the Questions endpoint is stored in the `apiBaseUrl` variable in the `@battle-time/common` package.
- Minimal Decencies - You are not permitted to install any additional npm packages.
- Animations - The transition between questions should be animated
- Responsiveness - The interface must be responsive. The provided Invision design is laid out for desktop. It is your responsibility to adjust the layout for mobile devices. Falling back to a vertically stacked layout is preferred.
- Usage of at least 1 behavior subject for storing global app state. See the "tip of the day" in index.tsx for an example.
